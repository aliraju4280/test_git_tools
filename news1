The Committee of Administrators, on Wednesday (October 9), communicated to Tamil Nadu Cricket Association, Haryana Cricket Association and the Maharashtra Cricket Association that they have been debarred from participating in the upcoming BCCI Annual General meeting and election, set to take place on October 23, as their respective constitutions are not in line with the Supreme Court-approved constitution.

The CoA had stated earlier in private communication that there were inconsistencies in the constitution that the three associations had registered with the Tamil Nadu Registrar of Societies.

However, R Ramasammy, TNCA secretary, said, "We have received that communication from CoA, with the electoral officer marked on it. Tomorrow is the final day for the officer to make the list. If we don't figure in that list, we will examine the option of going to court

The final list of the electoral roll will be released on Thursday. R Ramasammy, Mrinal Ojha and Riyaz Bagban were nominated from TNCA, HCA and MCA respectively to be a part of BCCI's AGM.
